      Parameters     : Adaptive estimation, communication systems performance, fading channels, frequency-division multiplexing, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems
      Findings       : 
                       * The proposed channel estimators compute the long-term features of the multipath channel model through a subspace tracking algorithm by identifying the invariant (over multiple OFDM symbols) space/time modes of the channel (modal analysis). 
                       * the fast-varying fading amplitudes are tracked by using least-squares techniques that exploit temporal correlation of the fading process (modal filtering)

      Journal        : National Key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China Chengdu, 610054, P.R. China
      Parameters     : Fast time-varying channel, nonintegral-delay, channel estimation, signal detection, ESPRIT.
      Findings       : * channel estimation and signal detection technique is presented for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system on fast time-varying fading channel with nonintegral-delays.
                       * This technique, based on a linear parametric channel model, rotationally employs estimating signal parameter via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) and interchannel interference (ICI) mitigation to get more accurate channel estimation and data detection. 
                       * Simulation results show that the proposed method is robust to changes in channel characteristics, and the performance of which is superior to other structures without ICI mitigation or with integral-delays.
